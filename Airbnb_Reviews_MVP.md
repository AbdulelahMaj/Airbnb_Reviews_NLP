# Airbnb Reviews Topic Modeling & Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction:

> In this project our task was to get a dataset to build an NLP model. We chose to analyze a dataset obtained from a website that collects Airbnb reviews called inside Airbnb.

## project Progress:

> - we cleaned the raw text data by removing digits, punctuation, special characters stop words, non-English words, converting words to lower case, lemmatization, and adding a spell checker.
> - We used the CountVectorizer tool to convetr the reviews into document-term matrix as unigram.
> - also we used TF-IDF tool.
> - we create NMF model but we still clean it.
> - we still trying with the NMF model cleaning it by adding some words to the stopwords such as hosts's name.

## Future work:

>- Using other liberies such as Spacy.
>- do sentiment analysis on the reviews.
>- apply extra models on topic modeling such as LDA and CoreX.
